    "\n",
    "BB84 is the first quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol, developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984. It allows two parties, we named as Alice and Bob, to securely exchange a cryptographic key that is immune to eavesdropping, thanks to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. The BB84 protocol relies on two non-orthogonal bases for a single qubit.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Rectilinear (Z) Basis:**\n",
    "    * States: $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$\n",
    "    * Measurement Observable: $Z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Diagonal (X) Basis:**\n",
    "    * States: $|+\\rangle = \\frac{|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $|-\\rangle = \\frac{|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n",
    "    * Measurement Observable: $X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",

    "### Mathematical Properties\n",
