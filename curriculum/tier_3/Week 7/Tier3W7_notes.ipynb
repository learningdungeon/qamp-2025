    "\n",
    "In Week 6, we explored **QAOA** (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) to solve the **Max-Cut** problem. The **Goal** is to find a bitstring $x$ that minimizes a cost function $C(x)$. To achieve it, we constructed a cost Hamiltonian $H_C$ such that its ground state (lowest energy state) encoded the solution. We used a specific ansatz (alternating layers of Cost and Mixer unitaries) to find this ground state.\n",

    " ### What is the Schrödinger Equation?\n",
    " \n",
    " At the heart of quantum chemistry lies the Schrödinger Equation. The Schrödinger Equation describes the wave function of the particle. While you might seen it describing how particles move over time (in the time-dependent form), for VQE we care about the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation:\n",
    " $$\n",
    " H |\\psi\\rangle = E |\\psi\\rangle\n",
    " $$\n",
    " The equation above is the form after factoring out the time-dependent variable. This is an Eigenvalue Problem. It asks: \"Which states $|\\psi\\rangle$ remain unchanged (pointing in the same direction) when the operator $H$ is applied to them?\"\n",
    " \n",
    " Here is the breakdown of the components:\n",
    " * $H$ (The Hamiltonian):  This is the operator representing the Total Energy of the system. For a molecule, it sums up all the interactions: \n",
    "    * The *Kinetic energy* of the electrons.\n",
    "    * Attraction between negatively charged electrons and positively charged nuclei.\n",
    "    * Repulsion between electrons (this is the hard part to simulate!).\n",
    "    \n",
    "* $|\\psi\\rangle$ (The Eigenstate / Wavefunction): This vector represents a stable configuration of the electrons. If the system is in this state, its energy is definite and constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $E$ (The Eigenvalue): The specific scalar value representing the energy of the state $|\\psi\\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A system naturally wants to \"relax\" to its lowest possible energy. Therefore, our goal is to find the Ground State, the eigenvector $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ with the smallest possible eigenvalue $E_0$. This $E_0$ determines the molecule's stability, bond length and other chemical properties of the molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge of Fermions\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrons are **fermions**. They follow the **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Mathematically, this means their wavefunction must be **anti-symmetric**. If you swap two electrons, the wavefunction picks up a minus sign:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Psi(r_1, r_2) = -\\Psi(r_2, r_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits, however, are distinguishable. $|0\\rangle_1 |1\\rangle_2$ is not the same as $|1\\rangle_1 |0\\rangle_2$, and swapping them doesn't naturally generate a minus sign. To simulate electrons using qubits, we need a mathematical \"translator.\""

    "## 3. Mapping Fermions to Qubits: Jordan-Wigner\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to map the physics of electrons (orbitals being empty or occupied) to the physics of qubits (states being $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$). The standard method for this is the **Jordan-Wigner Mapping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define the Orbitals (Second Quantization)\n",
    "Instead of tracking electron positions, we track **orbitals**. We assign an index $j$ to each available orbital (spatial orbital $\\times$ spin).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example (4 Spin-Orbitals):** Imagine a simplified model with 4 spin-orbitals, labeled $0, 1, 2, 3$.\n",
    "    * Orbitals 0 & 1 could be the $1s$ shell (spin up/down).\n",
    "    * Orbitals 2 & 3 could be the $2s$ shell (spin up/down).\n",
    "\n",
    "We define fermionic operators for each orbital $j$:\n",
    "* **Creation Operator ($a^\\dagger_j$):** Creates an electron in orbital $j$.\n",
    "* **Annihilation Operator ($a_j$):** Removes an electron from orbital $j$.\n",
    "* **Number Operator ($n_j = a^\\dagger_j a_j$):** Counts if an electron is there (1) or not (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Map Occupancy to Qubits\n",
    "This is the easy part. We map the *presence* of an electron to the state of a qubit.\n",
    "* **Qubit $j$ represents Orbital $j$.**\n",
    "* **State $|0\\rangle_j$:** Orbital $j$ is EMPTY.\n",
    "* **State $|1\\rangle_j$:** Orbital $j$ is OCCUPIED.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "* State with electrons in orbitals 0 and 2: $|1\\rangle_2 |0\\rangle_1 |1\\rangle_0$ (or $|101\\rangle$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Map the Operators (The Parity String)\n",
    "This is the hard part. We must map the operators $a_j$ and $a^\\dagger_j$ to Pauli matrices ($X, Y, Z$) in a way that preserves the anti-symmetry (the minus sign when swapping).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jordan-Wigner transformation does this by attaching a \"string\" of $Z$ operators to every creation/annihilation operator. This string calculates the **parity** of all qubits *below* index $j$.\n",

    "**The Formula:**\n",
    "$$a^\\dagger_j \\rightarrow \\left( \\bigotimes_{k=0}^{j-1} Z_k \\right) \\otimes \\sigma^+_j$$\n",

    "* **$Z_k$ string:** This acts on all qubits $0$ to $j-1$. Since $Z|1\\rangle = -|1\\rangle$, this string effectively counts the number of electrons \"below\" orbital $j$ and applies a minus sign if that number is odd. This \"non-local\" string(strings that operates on all qubits, instead on one specific quibt) enforces the anti-symmetry!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (4 Orbitals):**\n",
    "Let's map the creation operator for orbital 2, $a^\\dagger_2$.\n",
    "* Target qubit: 2 (Apply $\\sigma^+_2$).\n",
    "* Parity string: Apply $Z$ to all qubits below 2 (Qubits 0 and 1).\n",
    "* **Result:** $a^\\dagger_2 \\rightarrow \\sigma^+_2 \\otimes Z_1 \\otimes Z_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(X_2 - iY_2) Z_1 Z_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Transform the Hamiltonian\n",
    "The molecular Hamiltonian is a sum of terms involving these operators. We substitute the qubit mappings into the Hamiltonian to get a sum of Pauli strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Hopping Term):**\n",
    "Consider a term representing an electron hopping from orbital 0 to orbital 2: $H_{hop} = a^\\dagger_2 a_0 + a^\\dagger_0 a_2$.\n",
    "1. Map $a^\\dagger_2 \\rightarrow \\sigma^+_2 Z_1 Z_0$.\n",
    "2. Map $a_0 \\rightarrow \\sigma^-_0$.\n",
    "3. Multiply: $a^\\dagger_2 a_0 = (\\sigma^+_2 Z_1 Z_0)(\\sigma^-_0) = \\sigma^+_2 Z_1 (Z_0 \\sigma^-_0)$.\n",
    "   Since $Z_0 \\sigma^-_0 = \\sigma^-_0$ (check this!), the term becomes $\\sigma^+_2 Z_1 \\sigma^-_0$.\n",
    "4. Convert to X/Y:\n",
    "   $$\\sigma^+_2 Z_1 \\sigma^-_0 = \\frac{1}{4} (X_2 - iY_2) Z_1 (X_0 + iY_0)$$\n",
    "   $$= \\frac{1}{4} (X_2 Z_1 X_0 + i X_2 Z_1 Y_0 - i Y_2 Z_1 X_0 + Y_2 Z_1 Y_0)$$\n",

    "## 4. The VQE Ansatz\n",

    "In the context of quantum computing, particularly for variational algorithms like VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver), Heuristic Ansatz refers to a trial wavefunction (quantum circuit) that is designed based on general principles of quantum gate operations and hardware constraints, rather than specific physical or chemical knowledge of the problem being solved. This ansatz ignores the chemistry. Instead, it asks: \"What is an expressive circuit that is easy to run on this specific quantum computer?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* The structure is several layers of single-qubit rotations ($R_y, R_z$) followed by entangling gates ($CNOT$) in a repeating pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is easy to implement on near-term hardware (NISQ) which it has shallow depth that is less susceptible to noise. However, it doesn't know any chemistry. It might have to search a massive space to find the right state ( and prone to \"Barren Plateaus\" that we briefly discussed in Week 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:** `EfficientSU2` in Qiskit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chemistry-Inspired Ansatz (UCCSD)\n",
    "It is a type of trial wavefunction designed specifically to model the electron interactions within a molecule, incorporating physical principles like electron number conservation and spin symmetry, and the most common chemistry-inspired ansatz is Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structure: The circuit is mathematically derived to explore only states that make physical sense (preserving the number of electrons, spin, etc.). It starts from the Hartree-Fock state (a simple approximation where the electron fill the lowest energy orbitals). Then, the ansatz adds \"excitations\" (apply unitary operations to move electrons from occupied to empty orbitals).\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can reach high precision which typically finds the ground state with fewer parameters compare to a generic circuits. However, it has a very deep circuit model which requires many $CNOT$ gates, making it hard to run on noisy hardware without error mitigation."
