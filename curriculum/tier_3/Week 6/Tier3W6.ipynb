It can hop from the state $|011\\rangle$ to $|111\\rangle$ or $|001\\rangle$, etc., creating a quantum interference so that all the \"bad\" solutions destructively interfere (cancel out) and the \"good\" solutions constructively interfere (add up) as a result. We will discuss it later.\n",

Applying $U_M(\\beta)$ (which are $R_x$ gates) \"mixes\" the states, allowing the algorithm to explore the entire solution space and preventing it from getting \"stuck\" in a local minimum. For problems with *constraints* (e.g., \"find the best solution that has *exactly* 3 nodes in set '1'\"), this mixer is inefficient because it explores invalid states. In those cases, different \"constraint-preserving\" mixers are used, such as an **XY-Mixer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of layers, $p$, is the most important hyperparameter. It controls the fundamental trade-off of the algorithm:  **As** $p \\to \\infty$**,** The QAOA ansatz is guaranteed by the adiabatic theorem to produce the *exact* optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For small $p$, the ansatz is only an *approximation*, as $p$ increases(More layers), the approximation quality gets better. However, deeper circuit is more vulnerable to **decoherence**. Also, the classical optimizer has to find the best values for $2p$ parameters. As $p$ increases, the \"cost landscape\" can become flat, creating \"***barren plateaus***\" where the gradient is zero, making it very hard for the optimizer to find the right direction. The 2p parameters $(\\gamma_1, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\gamma_p, \\beta_p)$ are the $\\vec{\\theta}$ that the classical optimizer will tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** “Cost landscapes” is a way to visualize the optimization problems. It is plot with **cost function** vs. **parameters $\\theta$,** where we will see the  coordinates at the lowest point of the graph is the best parameters to give lowest cost, which is the solution that we need for optimization problem. **Barren plateaus,** as mentioned above is the case where the whole graph appears almost perfectly flat. This is the problem arise where we don’t have lowest point of coordinates on a almost flat graph."
