# Marble Energy Lab — Activity Notes

Setup options:

- Real tray and three small bowls or cups labeled High, Medium, Low.
- Paper "bowls" drawn as three zones on a sheet and taped inside a tray.
- If no marble, use a coin or small ball.

Key tips:

- Keep it qualitative and fun.
- Encourage students to talk about "deeper bowls", "settling", and "where the marble likes to go".
- Make the connection at the end: upper tiers change parameters in a quantum circuit instead of tilt, but the **goal is the same** — help the system find its lowest energy state.
