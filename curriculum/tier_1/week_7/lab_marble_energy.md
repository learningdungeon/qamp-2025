# Lab — Marble Energy Lab

## Part A — Meet the bowls

1. Label your three zones: **High**, **Medium**, **Low**.
2. Place or draw them inside your tray so the marble can roll into any of them.

## Part B — Tilt setting 1

1. Choose a way to hold the tray (almost flat).
2. Roll or slide the marble 10 times from the same start spot.
3. Each time, write down which bowl it lands in.
4. Count how many times the marble landed in:
   - High: ______
   - Medium: ______
   - Low: ______
5. This is **Setting 1**.

## Part C — Tilt setting 2

1. Change how you hold the tray (a little tilt in a new direction).
2. Roll or slide the marble 10 times again.
3. Count and record the landings for High, Medium, and Low.
4. This is **Setting 2**.

## Part D — Tilt setting 3

1. Pick one more new way to hold the tray.
2. Roll or slide the marble 10 more times.
3. Count and record the landings.
4. This is **Setting 3**.

## Part E — Pick your best setting

On your worksheet:

- Circle the setting that gave you the **most** landings in the Low bowl.
- Finish this sentence:

> "Our best tilt was Setting __ because the marble landed in the Low bowl __ times out of 10."

## Part F — Big question

In one or two sentences, explain:

> "How is this like a system trying to find a **low energy** state?"
