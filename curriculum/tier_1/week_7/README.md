# Week 7 — Marble Energy Lab (Tier 1, Grades 6–8)

**Big idea:** A system will often settle into its **lowest energy** state, like a marble rolling into the deepest bowl.

Higher tiers use a method called VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) to search for low energy states on a quantum computer.  
In Tier 1, we use **bowls and marbles** to build that intuition.

## What you will do

- Work with an "energy board" that has three bowls: **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**.
- Try three different **tilt settings** for the board.
- For each setting, roll a marble several times and count how often it lands in each bowl.
- Decide which tilt setting helps the marble find the **Low** bowl most often.
- Explain, in your own words, how your strategy changed and why you picked your best setting.

No formulas here. Just counting, comparing, and telling the story of where the marble likes to settle.
