# Teacher Guide — Week 7 (Tier 1) Marble Energy Lab

## Goal

Students leave with the idea that:

> When we let a system relax, it tends to settle in the **lowest energy** place.

We model this with marbles in bowls and simple counting.  
Upper tiers will connect this to VQE and ground states.

## Learning outcomes (plain language)

Students can:

- Describe a "low" bowl as a place the marble likes to end up.
- Compare three tilt settings using simple counts (how many times the marble landed in each bowl).
- Pick the best tilt and explain why it helps the marble find the Low bowl.
- Say one sentence that connects this to quantum stories, for example:  
  "In quantum land, we search for the lowest energy state too."

## Materials

- A tray or box lid for each team (or one large demo tray at the front).
- Three bowls or target zones inside: **High**, **Medium**, **Low**.
- One marble or small ball per team (a coin can work if you slide it).
- Week 7 worksheet for each student or pair.

If you do not have real bowls, draw three labeled zones on paper and tape the paper into the tray.

## Suggested flow (about 35–40 minutes)

1. Hook (3–5 min)  
   Ask: "If I roll a marble on a bumpy table with three dips, a shallow one, a medium one, and a deep one, where do you think it will stop most often?"  
   Let students guess.

2. Set up the energy board (5 min)  
   Show High / Medium / Low bowls or zones.  
   Explain: "The Low bowl is like low energy. The marble will try to settle there if we give it a chance."

3. Experiment: three tilt settings (15–20 min)  
   For each setting:
   - Students agree on a tilt (for example, almost flat, gentle tilt left, gentle tilt right).
   - Roll or slide the marble 10 times from roughly the same start spot.
   - Record how many times it ends in each bowl (High, Medium, Low).
   - Change the tilt before the next setting.

4. Discuss results (5–7 min)  
   Ask:
   - "Which tilt setting gave you the most landings in the Low bowl?"
   - "Did any setting trap the marble in a higher bowl?"

5. Connect to VQE (2–3 min)  
   Script idea:  
   "In higher tiers, we use a method called VQE. We adjust 'settings' on a quantum circuit, then measure how high or low the energy looks. We keep changing the settings to find the lowest one, just like you tuned the tilt to help the marble find the deepest bowl."

Keep language warm and simple: "deeper bowl", "settles", "energy story".  
Do not use equations or matrices with Tier 1.
