# Teacher Guide — Week 6 (Tier 1) Quantum Courier

Goal:
Help students describe routes as "noisy" or "calm", test a few options, and explain why one route is better using simple numbers and everyday language. This is a story version of what higher tiers call QAOA on a small graph.

Learning outcomes (plain language):
- Describe a route from Start to Goal.
- Explain that each road has a noise number and the best route has the smallest total.
- Show, with numbers, how their route improved from first guess to final choice.
- Use words like "explore", "avoid bad roads", "improve our guess".

Flow (about 35–40 minutes)

1. Hook (3 min)
   - Story: "You are a bike courier in a small city. Some roads are full of bumps and construction; others are smooth. You want the calmest route."
   - Show the map and point at the noise numbers on each road.

2. Round 1 – Guess (8 min)
   - Students pick one route from Start to Goal and label it "Guess Route".
   - They add the noise numbers (keep totals small, like 3–10).
   - They record the total on the worksheet.

3. Round 2 – Test ideas (10 min)
   - Give each team two Route Idea cards (for example: "Try going through the park", "Avoid Construction Street").
   - They trace those routes, add the numbers, and compare totals.

4. Round 3 – Improve and explain (8 min)
   - Teams circle their calmest route and write 2–3 sentences:
     "We chose this route because... It is calmer than... Next time we would..."

5. Bridge to higher tiers (3–5 min)
   - Say: "In upper tiers, we turn this map into a math problem and use an algorithm called QAOA on a quantum computer to help search for good routes. Today you did the idea of that search by hand."

Materials:
- One printed map board per team (from activities/quantum_courier).
- Route Idea cards (2 per team).
- Pencils or markers, scrap paper if students want it.

Language to use:
- "bumpy / calm", "noisy / quiet", "total noise score", "best route we found".
- Avoid words like "Hamiltonian" or "cost function". Those are for Tiers 2–4.
