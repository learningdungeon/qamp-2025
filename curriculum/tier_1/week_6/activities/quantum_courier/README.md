# Quantum Courier — Activity Notes

Use this folder for:

- Map boards: small city graphs with Start and Goal and numbered roads.
- Route Idea cards: short hints like "Try crossing the bridge" or "Avoid Construction Street".

Quick setup:

1. Print one map and two Route Idea cards per team.
2. Keep noise numbers small (1–3) and totals between about 4 and 12.
3. Make sure there are at least three different routes from Start to Goal.

This game is a story and strategy version of what higher tiers call "QAOA on a simple graph".
