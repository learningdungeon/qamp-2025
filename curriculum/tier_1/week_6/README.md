# Week 6 — Quantum Courier: Pathfinding Game (Tier 1, Grades 6–8)

**Big idea:** Some routes are "bumpy" and some are "calm". We want to find a calm path through a tiny city map.

Later tiers use an algorithm called QAOA to help choose good paths.
In Tier 1, we play the Quantum Courier board game and practice:

**Guess → Test → Improve → Explain.**

## What you will do

- Use a small city map with roads and "noise numbers" (1, 2, 3).
- Start as a courier at Start and try to reach Goal.
- First, pick a Guess Route and add up its noise numbers.
- Then test two more routes from Route Idea cards.
- Choose the calmest route (smallest total noise) and explain why in your own words.

We use simple adding and comparing. No quantum formulas, just patterns and good strategies.
