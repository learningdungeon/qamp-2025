# Lab — Secret Code Post

Work with a partner. One person is SENDER and one is RECEIVER.

## Part A — Sender prepares

1. SENDER chooses 8 bits (0 or 1) and writes them in a row.
2. For each bit, SENDER also chooses a color:
   - B = Blue view
   - R = Red view
3. Fill in the Sender colors row and Sender bits row on your sheet.

## Part B — Receiver guesses

1. RECEIVER, without looking at the Sender's colors, chooses a random color (B or R) for each of the 8 spots.
2. Fill in the Receiver colors row.

## Part C — Compare and keep

1. Now compare colors, one position at a time.
2. If the colors match, circle that position and keep the Sender's bit there.
3. If the colors do not match, put an X on that position and discard that bit.
4. Write the kept bits, in order, on the "Shared Key" line.

## Part D — Decode the postcard

1. Split your Shared Key into pairs: for example 0 1 | 1 0 | 0 0 ...
2. Use your teacher's code dictionary. For example:
   - 00 → S
   - 01 → U
   - 10 → N
   - 11 → ☀
3. Decode your postcard and write or draw it in the space on your worksheet.

## Part E — Optional Round 2 (with Eve)

1. Add a third person as "Eve" who pretends to read and resend bits.
2. Repeat Parts A–D.
3. Compare how many mismatches you saw:
   - Round 1 (no Eve)
   - Round 2 (with Eve)

On your worksheet, explain in your own words how mismatches can be a warning sign that someone was listening.
