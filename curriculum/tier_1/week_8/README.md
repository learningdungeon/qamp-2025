# Week 8 — Secret Code Post (Tier 1, Grades 6–8)

**Big idea:** Two friends can create a **shared secret code** by making random choices, then keeping only the places where they matched. If someone listens in, it leaves clues in the pattern.

Higher tiers call this BB84 and study it with math.  
In Tier 1, we play a **post office game** with colors and arrows.

## What you will do

- Work in pairs as **Sender** and **Receiver**.
- The Sender creates a row of bits (0s and 1s) and chooses a random color (Blue or Red) for each.
- The Receiver guesses colors for each position without seeing the Sender's choices.
- You compare and keep only the spots where your colors **match**.
- Those matching bits become your **shared secret key**.
- Use that key to unlock a tiny **secret message** like a short word or symbol.

No equations, just matching, crossing out, and simple decoding.
