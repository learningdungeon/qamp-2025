# Secret Code Post — Activity Notes

Use this folder for:

- Blank code sheets with:
  - Sender colors row (B / R)
  - Sender bits row (0 / 1)
  - Receiver colors row (B / R)
  - Shared Key row
  - Space for decoded message or drawing
- A simple 2-bit to symbol dictionary that you can change per class.

Tips:

- Keep it playful and light. This is a secret postcard game, not a full cryptography lecture.
- Let students name their postcards (for example: SUN, TREE, WAVE).
- If you use an "Eve" eavesdropper in Round 2, keep it quick and focus on the pattern:
  more mismatches can mean someone interfered.

Upper tiers can point back to this activity when they introduce BB84 and formal security proofs.
