# 💻 tier_3 Folder: Qiskit Developer Focus (Undergraduate / Developer)

This folder contains all curriculum materials designed for **Tier 3**, targeting users with an existing background in programming and linear algebra (e.g., undergraduate students and software developers).  
This tier is dedicated to mastering the **formalism, notation, and tools** required to build and execute quantum programs using **Qiskit**.

> **🎯 Guiding Philosophy**  
> The focus here is rigorous definition combined with hands-on implementation.  
> Students must learn to read, write, and manipulate quantum states and operations using the *tools of the trade*.

> **🎓 Certification Alignment Goal**  
> The level of rigor, topic complexity, and emphasis on practical implementation are explicitly designed to prepare users to pass the **Qiskit Developer Certification** and to confidently engage in Qiskit-based software development.

> **🚀 Learning Goal**  
> Move beyond visualization (Tier 2) toward **Dirac notation** ($|\psi\rangle$), **unitary matrices**, and modern **Qiskit primitives** such as the *Estimator*.

> **📚 Key Topics**  
> Lessons cover the formal state vector and the **Born rule** (Week 1), unitary time evolution, **density-matrix modeling** of simple noise channels, and the formal structure of algorithms such as **VQE** and **QAOA**.

> **📖 Source Reference**  
> All planning aligns with the *“Tier 3 (Undergraduate) – Qiskit Developer Focus”* column in the **Master Tiers Focus – Tiers-Based Checklist** (see `docs/technical/`).

> **🛠 Contribution Guidelines**
>
> **Mandatory Notation**  
> All materials must use **Dirac notation** ($|\psi\rangle$, $\langle\psi|$, $\langle\phi|\psi\rangle$).
>
> **Focus on Qiskit Primitives**  
> Lessons should emphasize modern Qiskit development using **primitives** (*Estimator*, *Sampler*) rather than legacy execution methods.
>
> **Linear Algebra is Assumed**  
> Content may assume prior knowledge of vector spaces and matrix multiplication when explaining unitary evolution and gate operations.
