    "## 2️⃣ Context and Narrative (Entry Point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a special toy.  \n",
    "This toy is different from all the others because it **cannot decide** what it is until someone looks at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it behaves like a **0**,  \n",
    "sometimes like a **1**,  \n",
    "and sometimes… like **both at the same time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only when you observe it does the toy finally choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "This toy is called a **qubit**.\n",

    "## 3️⃣ Core Quantum Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Superposition and measurement**\n",
    "\n",
    "> A quantum system can exist in more than one possible state  \n",
    "> until it is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ Challenge Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a **toy, game, or short story** that represents a *toy qubit*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The toy must have **two possible outcomes**\n",
    "- The outcome must be **undefined before observation**\n",
    "- The act of observing must **change or define** the result\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single correct solution.  \n",
    "Creativity and explanation are more important than precision.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Type of foundation:**  \n",
    "☑ Narrative and intuitive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumed prior knowledge:**  \n",
    "- Counting  \n",
    "- Simple probability  \n",
    "- Everyday observation (coins, cards, colors)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emerging understanding:**  \n",
    "- Indeterminacy  \n",
    "- Observation affects outcomes  \n",
    "- Difference between *before* and *after* measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ Expected Deliverable\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose **one** of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  A drawing or poster of the toy qubit  \n",
    "-  A short story explaining how the toy works  \n",
    "-  A simple physical game using everyday objects  \n",
    "\n",
    "Include a brief explanation answering:\n",
    "\n",
    "> What happens **before** and **after** observing the toy?\n",

    "## 7️⃣ Time and Modality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggested duration:**  \n",
    "⏱️ 45–60 minutes\n",

    "**Modality:**  \n",
    "☑ Individual  \n",
    "☑ Small groups (2–3 students)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Hints (Progressive Guidance)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What happens to a coin **before** it lands?\n",
    "2. Can something be undecided without being broken?\n",
    "3. Does looking always produce the same result?\n",
    "4. What changes when someone observes?\n",
    "5. Can two people see different outcomes?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️⃣ Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is successful if the student can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain that the toy does **not decide immediately**\n",
    "- Describe what observation does to the system\n",
    "- Use their own words, drawings, or stories to explain the idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct scientific terminology is **not required**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Optional Extension (Stretch)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What if two people observe the toy at different times?\n",
    "- Can the toy ever return to its previous state?\n",
    "- Is the toy random, magical, or rule-based?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note for the Teacher\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is **not about correctness**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on:\n",
    "- Student intuition\n",
    "- The language students use to describe uncertainty\n",
    "- Their understanding of observation as an active process\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid introducing formal quantum terminology too early.  \n",
    "Let curiosity lead the discussion.\n",
