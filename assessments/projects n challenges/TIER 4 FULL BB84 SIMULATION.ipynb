    "\n",
    "Classical cryptography assumes that certain mathematical problems are hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum cryptography assumes something stronger:\n",
    "> **the laws of physics cannot be bypassed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The BB84 protocol is not secure because of computational complexity,  \n",
    "but because **quantum states cannot be measured without disturbance**.\n",

    "This project explores BB84 as a **fully quantum communication protocol**,  \n",
    "analyzing how information, measurement, and disturbance are encoded in the formalism of quantum mechanics.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Core Quantum Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information gain implies disturbance**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any attempt to extract information from non-orthogonal quantum states  \n",
    "> necessarily alters those states.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle is not technological — it is fundamental.\n",

    "- Analyze the effect of an eavesdropper (Eve)\n",
    "- Explain how security emerges from quantum mechanics itself\n",
    "\n",
    "No numerical simulation or programming is required.  \n",
    "The emphasis is on **formal reasoning and physical interpretation**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Alice prepares single-qubit states chosen from two **conjugate bases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computational (Z) basis:\n",

    "  |-\\rangle = \\frac{|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transmitted qubit is prepared as one of these four states, encoding both:\n",
    "- a classical bit\n",
    "- a choice of basis\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point:  \n",
    "states from different bases are **non-orthogonal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️⃣ Measurement, Collapse, and Basis Mismatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob measures each incoming qubit using a randomly chosen basis (Z or X).\n",
    "\n",
    "If Bob chooses the same basis as Alice, the measurement outcome is deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the bases differ, the measurement outcome is probabilistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\langle 0 | + \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After transmission, Alice and Bob publicly compare bases and **discard mismatched measurements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining bits form the **raw key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️⃣ Eavesdropping as a Quantum Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an eavesdropper Eve performing an intercept–resend attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eve measures the qubit in some basis and resends a new state to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces a disturbance because Eve cannot know Alice’s basis in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, Eve’s intervention replaces Alice’s pure state $|\\psi\\rangle$ with a mixed state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho = \\sum_i p_i |\\phi_i\\rangle \\langle \\phi_i|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This disturbance propagates to Bob’s measurements, producing an **observable error rate**.\n",

    "## 9️⃣ Error Rates and Detectability\n",
    "\n",
    "If Eve measures randomly in Z or X bases, she introduces a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of approximately:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{QBER} \\approx 25\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob estimate this error rate by sacrificing a subset of their raw key.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nonzero QBER is not just noise —  \n",
    "it is **evidence of information leakage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security is therefore inferred, not assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔟 Security as a Physical Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "BB84 security does not rely on secrecy of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "It relies on three quantum facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Non-orthogonal states cannot be perfectly distinguished\n",
    "2. Measurement disturbs quantum states\n",
    "3. Disturbance leaves statistical traces\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dirac notation, security is encoded directly in the inner products of states.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Explain security without invoking computation hardness\n",
    "- Relate inner products to information leakage\n",
    "- Argue why BB84 is *inevitably* quantum\n",

    "##  Note for the Teacher\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is intentionally demanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourage participants to:\n",
    "- Treat BB84 as a physical experiment, not a protocol recipe\n",
    "- Use equations as arguments, not decorations\n",
    "- Reflect on the meaning of “security” beyond cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a transition point from *learning quantum computing*  \n",
    "to *thinking like a quantum information scientist*.\n",
    "\n",
