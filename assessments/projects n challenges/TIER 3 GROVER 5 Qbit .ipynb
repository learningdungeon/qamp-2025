    "## 2️⃣ Context and Narrative (Entry Point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching is one of the most common computational tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a classical computer, searching through $N$ possibilities usually requires checking them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing offers a different approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of testing each option individually, a quantum system can **amplify the probability of the correct answer** through controlled interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores **Grover’s algorithm** using a system of **5 qubits**, focusing on *why* it works rather than just *how* to implement it.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Core Quantum Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amplitude amplification through interference**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Grover’s algorithm increases the probability of measuring a marked state  \n",
    "> by systematically redistributing probability amplitudes.\n",
