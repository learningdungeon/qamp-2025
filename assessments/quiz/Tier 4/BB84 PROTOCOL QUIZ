## 🔄 Part B: Protocol Steps Sequencing

**Instructions:** Number the steps in the correct chronological order (1-4):

- [ ] Alice and Bob publicly compare which bases they used
- [ ] Alice encodes random bits using randomly chosen bases (Z or X)
- [ ] Bob measures received qubits using randomly chosen bases (Z or X)
- [ ] They keep only the bits where their bases matched

**Correct Sequence:** ______ → ______ → ______ → ______

## 💻 Part D: Code Implementation

**Task:** Complete the quantum encoding function for BB84:

```python
def encode_qubit(bit, basis):
    """
    Encode a classical bit into a quantum state for BB84 protocol
    
    Parameters:
    bit (int): 0 or 1
    basis (str): 'Z' or 'X'
    
    Returns:
    QuantumCircuit: Circuit encoding the bit
    """
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
    
    if basis == 'Z':
        # Z basis: |0⟩ for 0, |1⟩ for 1
        if bit == 1:
            qc.______(0)  # Apply which gate to make |1⟩?
    else:  # X basis
        # X basis: |+⟩ for 0, |-⟩ for 1
        if bit == 0:
            qc.______(0)  # Apply which gate to make |+⟩?
        else:
            qc.______(0)  # First make |1⟩
            qc.______(0)  # Then transform to |-⟩
    
    return qc
