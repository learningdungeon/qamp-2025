    "## 🧩 Coding Task 3 — Two Independent Bits\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Objective\n",
    "Simulate a system composed of two independent bits and observe the possible measurement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Context\n",
    "When multiple systems are independent, the result of measuring one does not affect the other.  \n",
    "This task reinforces how combined systems behave when there is **no correlation** between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Instructions\n",
    "1. Define two independent bits with their own probabilities.\n",
    "2. Measure both bits repeatedly.\n",
    "3. Combine the results into two-bit outcomes.\n",
    "4. Count and print how often each outcome appears.\n"
