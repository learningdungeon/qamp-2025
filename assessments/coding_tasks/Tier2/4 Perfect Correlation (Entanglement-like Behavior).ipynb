    "##  Coding Task 4 — Perfect Correlation (Entanglement-like Behavior)\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Objective\n",
    "Simulate a two-bit system where the measurement outcomes are perfectly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Context\n",
    "In some systems, the results of measurements are not independent.  \n",
    "Instead, the outcomes are **linked**: measuring one bit determines the result of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior prepares us to understand **quantum entanglement**, without using quantum hardware yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Instructions\n",
    "1. Simulate a system that can only produce the outcomes `00` or `11`.\n",
    "2. Each outcome should occur with the same probability.\n",
    "3. Repeat the experiment many times.\n",
    "4. Count and print the measurement results.\n"
