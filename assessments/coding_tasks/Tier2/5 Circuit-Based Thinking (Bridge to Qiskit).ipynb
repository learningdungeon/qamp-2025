    "Simulate a simple circuit using step-by-step operations on bits.\n",
    " Context\n",
    "Quantum programs are built as **circuits**: sequences of operations applied in a specific order.  \n",
    "In this task, we model that idea using Python functions, preparing the transition to real quantum circuits in Qiskit.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Instructions\n",
    "1. Start from an initial two-bit state.\n",
    "2. Apply a Hadamard-like operation to the first bit.\n",
    "3. Measure the first bit.\n",
    "4. Apply a CNOT-like operation using the first bit as control.\n",
    "5. Print the final result.\n"
