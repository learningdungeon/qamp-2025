    "###  Objective\n",
    "Simulate repeated measurements of a bit that can take the values `0` or `1` at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Context\n",
    "In computing (and later in quantum computing), a **measurement** is a process that produces an observable result.  \n",
    "In this task, we use Python to simulate many measurements and count how often each outcome appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Instructions\n",
    "1. Generate random measurements of a bit (`0` or `1`).\n",
    "2. Repeat the experiment many times.\n",
    "3. Count how many times each result appears.\n",
    "4. Print the final results.\n"
